					<p>Hi! I'm <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/jacob-solomon/" target="_blank" >Jake</a>. I gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqTFi2U2Ebc" target="_blank" >this talk at the 2015 Code for America Summit</a>. It's about how our team is trying to make CalFresh (food stamps in CA) more amazing and what we're learning along the way.</p>

					<p>Fifteen years ago, in order to get Food Stamps, now called SNAP, you had to go through a lot. You had to get up before work to wait in line outside the welfare office, you had to fill out reams of paperwork, you had to get your fingerprints taken, and in the end you would get a stack of conspicuous paper that showed everyone around you what you were willing to endure.</p>

					<p>And here’s what it’s like today: You can apply online from home, complete your interview over the phone when you’re at work, and get a Debit Card sent to you in the mail. We have made incredible progress. And as a result,SNAP now supports nearly 50 million Americans per month [footnote], keeps over 2 million children out of poverty each year [footnote],  and may be the most important safety net program in the country. It’s amazing. We’re lucky to have it in this country.</p>

					<p>These small things add up to big things: In California, over 2M people qualify for SNAP but aren’t getting it...that’s more than the populations of San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland combined. But more importantly, people feel betrayed by their country.</p>
					<p>In many ways, the client still bears the burden when navigating social services, especially the young, the old, the disabled, the vulnerable. We still have a long way to go.</p>

					<p>Implementation is no longer a phase, it’s a process. And that process is called Delivery. <b>Delivery is the continual process of understanding and meeting user needs.</b></p>
					<p>Implementation happens once, delivery happens everyday. Implementation is about a sticking to the plan, delivery is about discovery. Implementation is complicated, delivery is simple (it’s really hard! But simple).
					</p>
					<p>And this is what our team at Code for America is doing: Learning to Deliver SNAP. So over the past year, we have started everyday with the same goal: Understand and meet user needs. That’s it. Every day. Over and over. And I want to show you what that looks like.</p>

					<p>At the start, some needs were in plain sight. They were small, but they happened everyday. For example, it’s tricky to check your SNAP balance, so we built an easier way.</p>

					<p>We discovered that the online application is really long...it’s like 30 screens and  200 questions. Turns out you don’t need all those questions, so we built a shorter one.</p>

				<div class="text-column col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">

				</div>
				<div class="text-column col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">
					<p>And then something really interesting happened, we discovered a new kind of user need. This time it was a single piece of paper. It turns out we were sending it to users, asking them to sign it, and waiting for it to come back in the mail. If they didn’t get this done, they didn’t get SNAP. But taking a closer look at the policy, and the law, we didn’t need that piece of paper at all. Getting rid of that piece of paper was a feature that met a user need...and we just happened to implement it with meetings and talking to a lawyer and ultimately a phone call to the director.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="text-column col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">
					<p>And suddenly we were no longer working just on a software project, but catalyzing operational change in government.</p>

					<p>Delivering against user needs has taken us from from software to operations, from operations to policy, and hopefully someday, from policy to law.</p>

					<p>Delivery is letting us transform government services from the inside out.</p>

				<div class="text-column col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">
					<p>In the last year, this is the team that has stepped forward to understand and meet user needs. What started as a side project working just with the director of SNAP in San Francisco, Leo O’Farrell, is being carried forward by dozens of people across counties, the state of California, nonprofits, food banks, and many others.</p>

					<p>The reason that you need all these people working together, the reason that Delivery is so hard, is that by and large our government services are not organized around people and their needs. And it takes a LOT of work and a LONG time to rearrange all the big bulky pieces. Redesigning government really is a generational project, and it feels like it.</p>
					<p>It can be supremely slow and frustrating and often you’ll feel like you’re not making any change at all. You’ll piss important people off because change hurts, which is especially hard for those of us who hate conflict. And sometimes you’ll make mistakes and end up with VERY unhappy users, which is especially hard to stomach if you’re a perfectionist.</p>
					<p>But these things are inevitable; it means you’re doing something very new and very worth doing. Often it feels really lonely and hopeless and you’ll just want to give up.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="27" class="slide-row row">
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-offset-1 col-md-4">
					<img class="slide" src="img/end-gif.gif" alt="">
				</div>
				<div class="text-column col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">
					<p>But we won’t let that happen, and that’s what’s so empowering and important about the Code for America Summit. If we all have perseverance and support each other, Delivery will take us exactly where we need to go, and we can build government services that put people first.</p>

					<p>Thank you and see you next year!</p>
